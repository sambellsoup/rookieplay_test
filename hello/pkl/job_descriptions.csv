For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. Worksheets are compiled until all failure modes and their causes and effects are identified. FMEAs will be performed initially at a functional level and as the design matures at a detail design (piece part) level. Functional analyses are used as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or piece part FMEA. Development of Criticality Analysis which is used to chart the probability of failure modes against the severity of their consequences. The results of this analysis identifies failure modes with relatively high probability and severity of consequences, allowing remedial effort to be directed where it will produce the greatest value. The FMEA/FMECA is a design tool used to systematically analyze postulated component failures and identify the resultant effects on system operations. Development of an FMEA requires that the analyst include all significant failure modes for each contributing element or part in the system. • Develop Reliability Analysis which involves construction of a model (life distribution) that represents the time to failure of the entire system based on the life distributions of the components, sub-assemblies and/or assemblies (black boxes) from which it is composed. In the conduct of this analysis the relationships between components are considered and decisions about the choice of components can be made to improve or optimize the overall product reliability.
